# Assembly Projects in MIPS

### This repository contains some assembly and C code from different projects from my Computer Organization course.
 
#### `Binomial Coefficient`

This project implements a recursive implementation of the binomial coefficient by following the MIPS procedure calling conventions and properly managing the stack. The program terminates when the N input equals zero (see input and output samples for more details). For more information about the binomial coeffiecient, check out: https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BinomialCoefficient.html

#### `Bubble Sort of Strings`

#### `Matrix Multiplication`

In this project matrices are represented as linear or one-dimensional arrays, instead of 2-D arrays, inside the program since it is harder to work with 2-D matrices in assembly. Notice that the first integer in the input sample file represents the dimensionaly of the two matrices (in this case squared-matrices) we are interested in multiplying, and this integer should not be greater than 10.

#### `Nursery Rhyme`

#### `Simple Sort of Structures`
