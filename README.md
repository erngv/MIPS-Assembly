# Assembly Projects in MIPS

### This repository contains some assembly and C code from different projects from my Computer Organization course.
 
#### `Binomial Coefficient`

#### `Bubble Sort of Strings`

#### `Matrix Multiplication`

In this project matrices are represented as linear or one-dimensional arrays, instead of 2-D arrays, inside the program since it is harder to work with 2-D matrices in assembly. The program terminates when the N input equals zero (see input and output samples for more details). For a review of matrix multiplication, check out https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-multiplying.html

#### `Nursery Rhyme`

#### `Simple Sort of Structures`
